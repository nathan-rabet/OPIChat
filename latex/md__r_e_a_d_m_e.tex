{\itshape OPIChat} is a simple IRC-\/like chat software. It is written in C and aims to be a simple, secured and easy to use. The project includes a client and a server.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md66}{}\doxysection{Installation and compilation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md66}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make sure to have the following dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (GNU) make
\item gcc
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Clone the repository
\item Build the project using the {\ttfamily make} command.
\item Both of client and server are in the {\ttfamily build/} folder.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md67}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md67}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md68}{}\doxysubsection{Server}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md68}
The server executable is called {\ttfamily opichat\+\_\+server} and is located in the {\ttfamily build/} folder.

To start the server, you must run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./opichat\_server <ip> <port>}

\end{DoxyCode}


Where {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}ip\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} is the IP address of the server and \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}{\ttfamily port}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} is the port where clients will connect to.

\begin{quote}
Note that you can use {\ttfamily localhost} as a loopback {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}ip\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} address to start the server. \end{quote}
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md69}{}\doxysubsubsection{Actions to perform}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md69}
No action is required for the server\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}{}\doxysubsection{Client}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}
The client executable is called {\ttfamily opichat\+\_\+client} and is located in the {\ttfamily build/} folder.

To start the client, you must run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./opichat\_client <ip> <port>}

\end{DoxyCode}


Where {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}ip\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} is the IP address of the server and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}port\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} is the port where the server is listening to.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md71}{}\doxysubsubsection{Actions to perform}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md71}
When the client launchs, you will deal with the command prompt.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Command:}

\end{DoxyCode}


At this step, you must enter a valid command name (as described in the \mbox{\hyperlink{md__p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l}{protocol}}).

If you enter a valid command, you will have one or both of these 2 following prompts\+:

{\bfseries{Parameters}} At this step, the client program valued that you entered a command which requires parameters.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Parameters:}

\end{DoxyCode}


To enter a parameter as a key/value pair, you must type\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<key>=<value>}

\end{DoxyCode}


Where {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}key\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}value\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} are respectively the key and the value of the parameter. Then press {\ttfamily Enter}.

\begin{quote}
The parameters prompt will always asks you key/value pairs forever until you press {\ttfamily Enter} and nothing else. \end{quote}
{\bfseries{Payload}} At this step, you must enter the content of the payload. Unless {\itshape Parameters}, no specific format is applied here.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Payload:}

\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{quote}
Some command (like {\ttfamily SEND-\/\+DM} or {\ttfamily BROADCAST}) will loop on the payload prompt forever. To exit the payload prompt, type {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}quit}. \end{quote}
